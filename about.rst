This blog is just the daily rantings of yet another college sophomore who 
thinks he is worth something, a proposition that may or may not attract him. 
But this is also a blog about ideas, an outlet for the rantings of an active mind,
telling people what can be done in ways they may or may not realize they can. 

The name of the blog might make you think what the hell is going on. So currying is the thing you do when you 
take a lot of functions together and string them up one after the other to perform a task functionally. Now
this blog is called Alfred for the help it gives me like Alfred did for the Batman. But it is curried in a lot of ideas.

### If you still do not understand, I don't think you should bother tryin more. You never will.
